<!-- Hello, curious soul! Welcome to the source code for my website :)
I decided to put together this website as a sort of portfolio/profile page where I can compile all my work. I build a lot of things
(mostly software), and I thought that I should have somewhere to showcase all of it. Stay tuned!
This site is developed, designed, and maintained by Kevin Cui. Last updated Dec 8, 2020 -->

                     <div id='personals' class='subdescrip'>Hi! I'm Erica! I have 5 years of professional experience in coaching chess, leading some talented juniors to first place finishes at
                       the New York State Scholastic Chess Championships. </div>

                     
                         <br><figcaption> I was at the 2019 national championship. Some may argue that I play TOO much chess.</figcaption>
                       </figure> </div>



                     <div id='personals' class='subdescrip'>I'm currently a B.Sc. Computer Science candidate @ the University of Rochester who's interested in equities research, especially concerning Asian markets. </div>
                     <div id = 'personals' class = 'subdescrip'> This is site was primarily to introduce prospective chess
                       students to my qualifications, though my blog will be linked as well. </div>

                     <div id='accounting' class='subdescrip'>I plan to graduate from the UofR in 2025 with an Computer Science degree. To broaden my understanding of world markets. I've also been an analyst in the University at Albany's investment group.
                     We are currently funded by the <a href="https://www.albany.edu/ciim">Center for Institutional Investment Management.</a> Our objective is to actively manage the university portfolio and outperform the S&P1500 index
                    by adhering to strict technical analysis to create a long-term investment strategy.</div>
                    <div id='accounting' class='subdescrip'> This experience has been really eye-opening in terms of how professional analysts work. It sunk in that people are stratified into those who
                    understand the financial systems implemented by governments and corporations,
                    and those who don't. I personally believe that financial literacy of
                  any degree is useful in all aspects of practical life, but I want to take this
                  further and make this my profession as to become fluent in the industry's methods of financial analysis.
                  The more value I bring to the table, the better.</div>
                  <div id='accounting' class='subdescrip'> As of now, my professional experience is limited to a few internships, the most fulfilling of which may have been in risk management at a public pension fund. The experience led to me to become interested in exploring more quantitative investment methods. However, the university investment group provides ample pracical experiences
                    in financial modeling with Excel. In the fall semester of 2021, I analyzed ASML holdings, a Dutch corporation in the semiconductor industry specializing in photolithography equipment, as well as Builder's First Source, an American manufacturer and supplier of building materials.
                    By creating an operating model and analyzing financial records, I recommended these stocks to be added to the university portfolio.
                  </div>
                  <div id = 'accounting' class = 'subdescrip'> I have linked our <a href=#resources>current holdings.</a> Our equity report is updated monthly. This will be updated to the best of my ability.
                    </div>
                    <div id = 'accounting' class = 'subdescrip'> Besides the current work I'm doing,  I'm interested in the Asian equities market, and hope to get the chance to work internationally.
                      Gaining and providing a more comprehensive perspective of this market is key to protecting an individuals' welfare in a global economy.
                      With this knowledge, I can more effectively evaluate and apply non-financial factors, such as geopolitics and culture, to my financial analysis.
                    </div>

                    <div id = 'accounting' class = 'subdescrip'>All in all, I hope that this course of study brings me fulfillment, and brings value to those around me.</div>






                     <div id='ACG' class='subdescrip'> I'll be linking my ACG blog here for all interested parties. The semester has been so busy, and I've made no progress with any A, C or G since September!
                     My most recent exploit was in Youth with You 2. I'll try and provide some sort of consistent and meaningful commentary on Asian Pop Culture soon. I recently had the opportunity to see AKB48 Team SH in Guangzhou as well. In the meantime, hang tight. 
                   

                     <div id='chess' class='subdescrip'>If you are here for chess, you've come to the right place. I've been an avid chess fan almost 7 years, and was truly hooked by the competitive
                     atmosphere of rated chess tournaments. If you put in the work and muster up the passion you'll be beating the big dogs in no time!</div>
                     <div id='chess' class='subdescrip'> Huge shoutout to the organization: <a href="http://www.chesstrm.org/">Make the Right Move.</a> which has been providing free chess tournaments in upstate New York since 2004!!!!</div>
                     <div id='chess' class='subdescrip'> Even if you don't choose me as your coach, if you live in this area I seriously recommend joining these tournaments either in-person or online. They are a great experience, and there is a strong pool of players. </div>
                     <div id='chess' class='subdescrip'> My coaching methods mostly comprise of puzzle training and book homework. Each curriculum is tailored to the specific students' level and needs. I usually reserve half an hour for scrimmages after lessons. </div>
